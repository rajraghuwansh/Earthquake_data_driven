The growing scientific evidence that climate change may also play a role in geological phenomena such as earthquakes, tsunamis and 
volcanic eruptions has left us in need of predicting them, in order to timely warn people of potentially damaging earthquakes, 
allowing people to respond to it appropriately, minimizing loss of life and property. Apart from predicting when an earthquake might 
occur, decision-makers and stakeholders also need an assessment of the potential damage following earthquake to formulate 
evacuation and risk reduction strategies.Classical risk assessment methods are resource and time 
consuming, and so we have employed machine learning algorithms to detect the extent of damage to buildings post an earthquake based 
on data about the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake in Nepal.
